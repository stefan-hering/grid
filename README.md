# Javagrid

This is the Javagrid programming language. It's a brutally impractical language inspired by [Befunge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Befunge). Code flow is simple and elegant by following one of 4 directions.

It follows 2 effective design principles:
* It's my language, I do what I want with it
* Whatever I did probably sounded like a good idea at the time
